                        <p>With 15+ years of  professional experience in hospitality, I bring a unique combination of real-world management, team leadership, and customer service experience to my web development service delivery.  Technology has been a passion of mine for as long as I can remember, and recently what started as a fascination with computer hardware construction and PC gaming became a full-fledged career change when I decided to pursue web-development full time.  I am thrilled to have the opportunity to both pursue my career passion and provide high-quality web development solutions to individuals and organizations alike.</p>

                        <p>I would describe my approach to web design as customer-focused and liaison-based: I see myself as the conduit through which your ideas transform from imagination to reality.  My years of experience working in hospitality have allowed me to develop specialized skills in customer service delivery, and I am determined to ensure the highest level of customer satisfaction, both with product delivery and your overall customer experience.</p>

                        <p>I invite you to browse through this portfolio to see examples of my work and imagine what I might do to elevate your brand and improve the experience of your user base.  Feel free to contact me with any questions using the information provided in the contact section.</p>

                        <p>Thank you for your visit, and I look forward to our future conversations!</p>
